      <h2>Joseph Chequers</h2>
      <p>I have owned a Whip Car for over 4 months now and I am loving it. I opted for the V8 engine on their new Alfa Romeo 8C and it performs amazingly. Its fuel economy isn't great, but thats what you would expect from one of these beasts. I have done around 6,000 miles since owning it, going on road trips and exploring the country's road and I have to say, it has really made me enjoy them more. I have recommended Whip to my other car enthusist friends, and I recommend that you try out Whip too, they are something really special.</p>

      <h2>Greg's Boat Yard</h2>
      <p>We have purchased around 7 vintage boats from Whip now and our customers love them. We rent them out to locals and they keep comingback from more. From their reliability to the way they look, these boats strike class in my boat yard and I couldn't be happier. They run smoothly and their engines are built to perfection (as I also build boat engines) and I don't think I could do a better job myself. Really good work from the team over at Whip.</p>

      <h2>Lincoln University</h2>
      <p>Since Whip is local to Lincoln, we reached out to them for our engineering department to see if they could provide us with some of their custom engines. Oh wow... these engines are the real deal, they are so effecient but pack an almighty punch. Our students have had a real blast taking the engines apart and checking out how you get your fuel injector to work as such a high rpm, truly fascinating. Thank you Whip for these excellent engines, they will be put to good use in the year to come.</p>
